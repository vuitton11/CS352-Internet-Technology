part 1 
i used simple agnostic elements .cc and .hh from github just like the ta said we can do 
i made a reciver and a sender file in click by using the reouter port from the elements arealy in comnetsii
for the reciver is just shows packets and discard it while idle uses simple agnostic elements and has a maxpacketsize of 100 then uses the router port just like revicer 
then just discards it 

then we made a show packet .cc and .hh following the sildes
